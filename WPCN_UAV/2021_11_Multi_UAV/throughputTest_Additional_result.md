## execution
execution: ```throughputTest_Additional.py```

## training and test settings
training iteration : 0 ~ 499 (500 iterations)
test iteration : 0 ~ 24 (25 iterations)

## algorithm
for each UAV and every time slot,
 * with probability ```probChooseMinThroughput```, UAV goes to the direction of the device with CURRENTLY MINIMUM throughput
 * with probability ```1.0 - probChooseMinThroughput```, UAV goes to the direction of the RANDOMLY SELECTED device
 * Find the best possible case of movement to move to the desired location.

## result
<b>better than genetic-based algorithm</b>, with more dataset and improvement of output value metric (```tanh(x)``` -> ```tanh(10x)```), correlation coefficient is around ```+0.771```

the set of ```{model prediction,ground truth}``` (in ```train_valid_result.csv```):
(the prediction converged to average)
